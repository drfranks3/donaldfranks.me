  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>Below is a select collection of projects over the years, from independent work to tasks assigned for UC Berkeley Computer Science students. Projects from the latter category are ones that I have found particularly worthwhile.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>CS 61B is a holistic introduction to Data Structures, allowing students to understand different methods of representing data. This includes evaluating the tradeoffs between structures such as Arrays, HashMaps, Trees, and Tries.</p>
    <p>Gitlet was the attempt to create a lightweight model of the <a href="http://github.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a> version control system. After a series of project proposals and trials, Gitlet became a semi-functional VCS. With the ability to add, unstage, commit, and branch, Gitlet proved to be one of the more difficult conceptual projects tasked.</p>

  <p class="description">
    <i class="fa fa-code" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    <span>Python</span>,
    <span>Jupyter Notebook</span>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Data 8 was a course piloted in Fall 2015 at UC Berkeley. In Spring 2016, various projects were assigned to students that tested the limits of Statistical Analysis, Data Management, and Data Visualization. One of these projects examined the water usage in the state of California.</p>
    <p>Analyzing data from the the IRS and State Water Resources Control Board, I determined that ZIP codes on average that have a high income are located near the coast or by bodies of water. People in the Bay Area in the top 10 highest-income water district used on average <strong>~24.6 more gallons of water</strong> per person per day than people in other districts.</p>

  <p class="description">

    <span>CodeIgniter</span>,
    <span>PayPal Integration</span>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Willow Glen Athletic Boosters is a club from San Jose, CA that seeks to aid in the financial and moral support of the student athletes and teams of both Willow Glen Middle School and Willow Glen High School.</p>
    <p>Their site required an overhaul from the original Wordpress design. Using the PHP framework <a href="https://www.codeigniter.com/"><strong>CodeIgniter</strong></a>, a complete responsive, redesigned website was made available to users. PayPal Integration with social network authentication made checkout for merchandise, membership, and donations quick, simple, and sleek.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Whimpsters.net was an online web-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_pet_site"><strong>virtual pet site</strong></a> that launched in 2008. With thousands of active members, new content was developed and released on a regular basis. Daily users would explore a 2D world, looking to collect these creatures and training them to "evolve" into larger, more complicated, more captivating designs.</p>
    <p>My role as co-administrator was to develop games, events, and scripts. In addition to maintaining the website, I also managed a MySQL Database with hundreds of thousands of "Whimpie" records for each pet in existence.</p>
