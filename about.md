  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello, there! I'm Donald, and I am an incoming 3rd year student at the University of California, Berkeley.
  I'm a mellow guy looking to inspire others through innovation and motivation. I <strong>love</strong> food and learning new things.
  I am very passionate about what I do, and it shows through both my work, and my <a href="/photography/">photography</a>. Have a look around!</p>

  <h3>Circle K International | <a href="//circlek.org/">circlek.org</a></h3>
  <p>Circle K International is the world's largest student-led collegiate service organization dedicated to serving the children
  of the world. With nearly <u>14,000 members in over 17 nations</u>, this organization—this family, rather—makes a positive impact each
  and every day. Circle K has a vast alumni network with mentors of all ages and in most professions. It acts as a home away from home,
  and is a fundamental part of my college career. <u>I currently serve the California-Nevada-Hawai'i District of over 3,200 members as
  the District Treasurer</u>.</p>

  <p>Although I only began back in 2014, I found myself captivated by the eye of the camera. It captures not only memories, but it also,
  briefly, suspends moments in time. With proper equipment, timing, lighting and patience, just about anything is possible. During
  graduation season, I set aside time to take pictures for close friends. On trips, it becomes my second lens for adventure.</p>
