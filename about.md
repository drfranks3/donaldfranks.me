  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello, there! I'm <strong>Donald</strong>, and I am a 3rd year student at the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>.
  I'm a mellow guy looking to inspire others through innovation and motivation. I love to learn new things, experience new cultures, and immerse myself in productive environments.</p>

  <p>From the age of 14, I began coding with an extremely simple Javascript <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>. I was captivated by the capabilities of sheer <i>text on a screen</i>, and for the next six years, I continued to expand my knowledge and learn new methods and technologies. Along the way, I picked up a couple other skills as well:</p>
  <ul id="skills">
    <li>HTML • CSS/SASS • Javascript</li>
    <li>Data Mining • PHP • SQL • Python</li>
    <li>Public Speaking • Project Management</li>
    <li>Fundraising • Budgeting • Event Planning</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="passion">Photography | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/143893005@N04/">flickr.com</a></h3>
  <p>In 2014, my friends from San Jose introduced me to the world of photography. They showed me just how powerful such advanced technology had evolved—the beauty of nature forever captured with the snap of a camera. Over the years, I have learned that with practice, proper timing, lighting and patience, just about anything is possible. During graduation season, I set aside time to take pictures for close friends. On trips, it becomes my second lens for adventure.</p>
